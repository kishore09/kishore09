# Howdy, I'm the Full-Stack Magician! 🎩✨

👨‍💻 Taming wild loops and herding bits for over 4 years. Front-end or back-end, I've got the full stack covered like a pro. My toolkit? It's a vibrant palette of JavaScript, React for crafting pixel-perfect spells, and a dash of HTML/CSS to keep things looking sharp.

🔧 In the engine room, Java 8, Spring Boot, and Node.js are my trusty wrenches, keeping the gears smooth within the microservices machinery.

📡 Crafting RESTful potions, conducting server-side symphonies, and navigating the SQL seas, I make data dance and servers sing. 

🔍 On a quest for a land where creativity meets complexity, ready to spin up some innovation and code up a storm!

🎯 Let's git-commit to the future of tech!
